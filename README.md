# Video Processing: Shorts Generator

## Overview
This project generates a captivating 30-second short video from a longer input video. The output video is formatted for social media platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok, with an aspect ratio of 9:16. It includes:
- Cropped frames for a portrait format.
- Preselected engaging clips.
- Background music.
- Smooth transitions and text overlays.

## Features
- Crop video to 9:16 without resizing.
- Merge multiple interesting segments into a 30-second reel.
- Add upbeat music and smooth transitions.
- Text overlays to describe scenes.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python moviepy
Instructions

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Video-Processing-Shorts-Generator.git
cd Video-Processing-Shorts-Generator

Place your input video (input_video.mp4) and music file (music.mp3) in the project folder.
Run the script:

    python short_video_generator.py

    Check the generated output (output_video.mp4) in the project folder.

Here’s how you can set up everything step-by-step, including the repository, generated video, and execution demonstration:
1. Setting Up Your Repository
Steps to Create a Public GitHub Repository

    Create a GitHub Account: If you don’t already have one, sign up at GitHub.
    Create a Repository:
        Go to your GitHub profile and click on the green "New" button.
        Name your repository (e.g., Video-Processing-Shorts-Generator).
        Add a description, choose "Public," and initialize it with a README file.
    Upload Files:
        Add the Python script (short_video_generator.py).
        Include:
            The input video file (if possible, compress it).
            The sample music file (royalty-free or specify a placeholder for users to download).
            An example output video (short video generated by the script).

Repository Structure

Your repository could look like this:

Video-Processing-Shorts-Generator/
│
├── README.md               # Explanation of the project and instructions
├── short_video_generator.py # Python code
├── input_video.mp4         # Input video (or provide a link in README)
├── music.mp3               # Background music file
└── output_video.mp4        # Generated short video

Write a README File

    Include the following in your README:
        Project overview.
        Step-by-step instructions to set up and run the script.
        Links to required dependencies (e.g., OpenCV, MoviePy).
        Notes on any large files (e.g., suggest users download from provided links).

2. Hosting the Videos
Step 1: Short Video

Upload the generated short video (output_video.mp4) to Google Drive or YouTube:

    Google Drive:
        Set the file visibility to "Anyone with the link".
        Copy the link and add it to your README or submission.
    YouTube:
        Upload as "Unlisted" (not Public) to ensure only those with the link can view.
        Include the link in your README or submission.

Step 2: Execution Video

Record yourself running the script using screen recording tools like OBS Studio (free and open-source). Ensure the video covers:

    Running the Python script.
    Showing the input video and generated short video.
    Highlighting key portions of the code.

Upload this video to YouTube (Unlisted) and share the link.
3. Example README.md

Here’s a sample README for your repository:
